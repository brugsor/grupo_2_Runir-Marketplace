# In retrospective...

This file contains all the conclusions of our sprints and thoughts we gathered through the process of working them out.

## Sprint 1 - Introduction and Wireframing

We managed to establish good lines of communication using WhatsApp and Slack. This allowed us to successfully work together in the repository and deliver the sprint on time. We will continue to work on communication to avoid misunderstandings and stay coordinated, specially now that we are working on the design of the site and this will require total collaboration.
