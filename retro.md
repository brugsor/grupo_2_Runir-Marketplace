# In retrospective...

This file contains all the conclusions of our sprints and thoughts we gathered through the process of working them out.

## Sprint 1 - Introduction and Wireframing

We managed to establish good lines of communication using WhatsApp and Slack. This allowed us to successfully work together in the repository and deliver the sprint on time. We will continue to work on communication to avoid misunderstandings and stay coordinated, specially now that we are working on the design of the site and this will require total collaboration.

## Sprint 2 - HTML + CSS

We definitely faced some schedule problems that made it hard for all of us to connect to our desired dailies. It was also hard to get everyone to manage the technologies (git and sass). We are going to work harder in scheduling our meetings so that everybody can attend and be compromised with the sprint objectives.

## Sprint 3 - Template Engines

> We had some issues with our CSS due there are many CSS files. We colaborate together to fix this. And we did it. Our CSS and EJS files work fine by now. And our pages have their styles once again.
