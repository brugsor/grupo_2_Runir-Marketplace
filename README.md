## Where did we get our inspiration from?

This site was inspired by the following:

- [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/)
  Due to its title bar, the way it presents the products, and the tabs that make it easy to navigate.

- [Cyprez.com](http://cyprez.com/home)
  We like the hovers and the parallax design.

- [BodegasAlianza.com](https://www.bodegasalianza.com/)
  We liked its slider showing new products and offers.

- [WildBeerCo.com](https://www.wildbeerco.com/)
  We are inspired by its HERO and the block design with smooth fading animations.

- [Apple.com](https://www.apple.com/)
  We love the simplicity and soberness of the site. It makes it easy to use and elegant to the eye.
